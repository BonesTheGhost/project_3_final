# project_3
The final project of the VU Full Stack Bootcamp

This repository will contain a number of different things as this project was a learning experience done 'on-the-fly.'

The first will be a working app that is part of a MERN course from Udemy. This app will have been created as a way for me to refresh the relevant technologies necessary to build an entire application with such scale in such short time.

Once that is complete, changes that I make, additions, etc. will be updated here so long as my memory doesn't fail me by then. The goal of rolling everything together into a single repository like this is to have an active commit history that demonstrates the efforts (and time) I have put in regardless of the state of the final product.

It should be noted that, the 'react-complete-guide' repo. is also part of such efforts to understand all of the moving parts of this project. The time invested there represented a refresher on React.js for me.
